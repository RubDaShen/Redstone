# Redstone
## Before starting...
This pseudo-programming language is still in development.
Anyways, if you need more detail about the documentation, you can ask me or sent me a message on dc or whatever.

## Why?
Our game engine needs some kind of programming language to execute things and do some extra stuff. I was thinking on using Lua but the integration of the compiler and related things to the language to other devices seems difficult and not worth the try. That's where this pseudo-programming language comes in handy. 
But isn't Json already a good source to store some instructions and then the engine can use those stored values to achieve the same result? Welp, yes but would be extremely large for complex animations, in fact, I recently tried Json files to act as my code containers but any little detail for a simple animation blew my mind and my computer too. Sooo, I began experimenting and, luckily, I found this way easier (to use) than Json (or any other format) files.

## Now what
Right now, we are not focusing on this project because it is overkill for what we achieved so far. Until the main project gets a solid base to start with, then we are not updating this pseudo-programming language (other projects are set as private; ask for permission).


Btw, this is not a programming language, yet~
